# Inside Gene Fusion

The proposed tool enables the analysis of DNA sequences using three alignment-free techniques, combining text-based and Graph Learning approaches in one tool. The tool integrates state-of-the-art methods to classify DNA sequences by leveraging deep learning models.
We propose a novel DL-based model that learns to recognize the hidden patterns that allow us to identify chimeric RNAs deriving from oncogenic gene fusions. 
This consists of a double-classifier framework which first classifies the sequence of the k-mers of a read, and then infers the chimeric information by giving as input the list of k-mer classes to a transformer-based classifier

In order to use the proposed tools, the requiremnets are needed.
```bash
pip installpip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Text-Based Tool
The first model that is defined within this project is the **gene classifier** model. 
The goal of this model is to correctly classify sentences in the source gene. 
More formally, we define a sentence as a string consisting of *n* words each 
separated by space, where each word is a *kmer*.

Starting with a read, we generate all possible kmers, of length ```len_kmer```, of the read. 
Let ```n_words``` be the number of kmers that make up a sentence, then all possible subsets of consecutive 
kmers of cardinality ```n_words``` are generated. This allows all possible sentences to be generated from a 
read. The goal of the classifier is to correctly classify a sentence to the source gene of the read used 
to generate the sentence

### Key Features
- **Gene Classification**: Fine-tune a pre-trained DNABERT model to classify the DNA sequence to its corresponding gene.
- **Chimeric Sequence Detection**: Utilize DNABERT embedding representations to train a deep learning model to classify DNA sequences as either chimeric or non-chimeric.

### Pre-process the Data for Gene Classification

#### From k-mers to sentences
The k-mers, i.e., all the substrings of length k which can be extracted from a DNA or RNA sequence, allow the local characteristics of
the sequences to be considered while lessening the impact of sequencing errors. In this work we represent a read using the list of its k-mers. This representation
allows the model to learn the local characteristics of reads and perform accurate classification. The solution proposed is based on the definition of a model capable of analyzing and classifying lists of k-mers. More precisely, given a read of length n and a value k, we extract the list of its n âˆ’ k + 1 k-mers. We split such list in consecutive segments of n_words k-mers. Then, the k-mers in a segment are joined together in a sentence by using a space character as a separator, thus producing a set of sentences. The following figure shows an example of sentences generated from an input read, using k = 4 and n_words = 3 (that is, 3 k-mers per sentence).

Run the following command to prepare your data for the DNABERT Gene Classifier model:

```bash
python3 source/gene_classifier_pre_process_data_filter.py
```

### Fine-Tune DNABERT for Gene Classification
To fine-tune the pre-trained model DNABERT for Gene Classification run the following command:
```bash
python3 source/dnabert_geneclassifier_fine_tune.py
```
Ensure that you modify the ```n_labels``` variable to match the number of labels in your customized dataset.

### Train Fusion Classifier Model
To identify a DNA sequence as chimeric or not, a Fusion Classifier model is trained on the embedding representation of the sequences given from the fine-tuned DNABERT.
The sentence-based representation previously described above is in turn exploited by a DL-based model for the detection of chimeric reads,
built as an ensemble of two sub-models: Gene classifier and Fusion classifier. The goal of Gene classifier is to classify a sentence into the gene from which it is
generated. It is trained using all the sentences derived from non-chimeric reads extracted from the transcripts of a reference set of genes (see the following figure).


To train Fusion classifier, a set of chimeric and non-chimeric reads is generated from the same reference set of genes used for training Gene classifier. Then, for
each read all the sentences of length n_words are generated and then provided as input to Gene classifier, previously trained. Gene classifier includes an embedding
layer, as well as several classification layers. The outputs of the embedding layer for all the generated sentences are grouped into a single embedding matrix, which
constitutes the input for Fusion classifier. Then, Fusion classifier uses such embedding matrices to distinguish between reads that arise from the fusion of
two genes and reads that originate from a single gene.

Run the followin script to create an embedding dataset for your sequences:
```bash
python3 source/create_embedding_dataset_with_dnabert_geneclassifier.py
```

Now the Fusion Classifier can be trained running the following script:
```bash
python3 source/gene_fusion_dnn.py
```
## Graph Based Tool
To overcome the limitations of the sentence-based approach, we employ a more advanced graph-based approach, utilizing De Bruijn graphs.In a De Bruijn graph, nodes represent k-mers, and edges indicate overlaps between consecutive k-mers. By applying GNNs, we are able to capture the complex topological dependencies between nodes through message-passing mechanisms. GNNs allow nodes to aggregate information from neighboring nodes, effectively learning intricate patterns that are essential for accurately identifying fusion events.

To efficiently create De-Bruijn graphs to run the experiments using GNNs the following script has to be run:
```bash
python3 source/pre_process_data_graph_and_hyper.py
```
We proposed a novel approach to efficiently train a GNNs on DNA sequneces.
For each kmerized sequence a De Bruijn graph is created, the informations inside the nodes of the graphs are crucial in order to train a pre-trained DNABERT model on the assumptions that the De Bruijn graphs
represents chimeric or not chimeric sequences.
As the previously approach, a pre-trained DNABERT model is fine-tuned to exctract the embeddings representation of the kmers inside the De Bruijn graph's nodes. This process is crucial to generate informative data for the GNNs model in order to have a more and precisious classifier model.

To train a pre-trained DNABERT model on chimeric or not chimeric sequences run:
```bash
python3 source/dnabert_fusion_fine_tune.py
```
Created the De Bruijn graphs and Fine-Tuned the DNABERT model on chimeric and not chimeric sequences, is possible to train the GNNs model runnign the script:
```bash
python3 source/gene_fusion_graph.py
```

## Hypergraph Based Tool

To further deepen the representational power, we introduce a hypergraph-based approach. Unlike traditional graphs, where edges connect only two nodes, hypergraphs allow for
hyperedges that connect multiple nodes simultaneously, thus capturing multi-way interactions that are commonly observed in biological systems. This higher-order representation
is particularly well-suited for modeling the complex interactions in gene fusion events. By using Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), which extend the capabilities of GNNs to
hypergraph-structured data, we can extract deeper patterns and relationships, offering a most sophisticated level of analysis for detecting chimeric reads. The methodology followed for this
approach is similar to that used in the graph-based approach, with the difference that in this case, each read is represented with a special hypergraph, which we call De Bruijn H-graph
A crucial aspect of defining a hypergraph is establishing the rule for constructing hyperedges. In our approach, we used the maximal cliques within De Bruijn graphs to generate hyperedges, capturing the structural complexity of reads. In a De Bruijn graph, nodes represent k-mers, and edges indicate overlaps between consecutive k-mers. A clique is a subset of nodes where every
pair is connected, representing complete connectivity. In this context, cliques highlight regions where k-mers overlap across multiple positions, forming continuous subsequences. 

To recognize the cliques into De Bruijn graphs and the cliques, run the script:
```bash
python3 source/gene_fusion_hypergraph.py
```

All the models are saved for future uses.
